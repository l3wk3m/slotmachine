Welcome to my JavaScript Slot Machine project.

The purpose of this project is to create a fun and immersive slot machine game using only JavaScript, HTML and CSS and deploy it on a cloud based platform. My aims are that the game be:

1. Intuitive - that the user can understand the stakes and the mechanics of the game with minor exploration
2. Responsive - that a similar game experience is felt whether playing on smartphone or laptop
3. Engaging - that the player enjoys the gaming experience

When I was young, my family used to holiday to Wexford over the summers. When we went to the amusements park in Courtown to go on the bumpers, we would always walk past the slot machines on the way in. I was always in awe of the simple game of chance at play there, though it would be years later before my parents would trust me enough to give money to play them.

The appeal of a slots game is that the desired outcome is immediately intuitive and when you match even two icons you'll watch your credit score increase.

The aim of the game is to keep going until you're completely out of credits. There is no ultimate win condition with a gambling game like this.

**Ideal User Experience**
